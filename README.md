# Live-Emotion-Detection
Live Emotion Detection is a real-time system that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect human emotions from facial expressions through a camera feed. It analyzes facial features using models like CNNs to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral instantly.

● Developed and trained a CNN model on the FER2013 dataset for multi-class emotion recognition.
● Enhanced model performance using data augmentation, EarlyStopping, and ModelCheckpoint techniques.
● Implemented real-time face detection and emotion recognition through OpenCV and webcam integration.
● Visualized model accuracy and loss trends using Matplotlib to evaluate training effectiveness.
